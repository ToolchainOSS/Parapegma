"""Spark prototype generation and pseudonymous research telemetry routes.

Spark remains isolated from existing Flow conversation state and requires no
registration. The client carries remix state as before. Each request also
contains a browser-local pseudonymous identifier and optional ThumbmarkJS
fingerprint; raw values are immediately keyed-hashed and never persisted or logged.

Conditions A ("Random Spark") and B ("Spark Wheel") are non-adaptive control
groups: they are served entirely from a researcher-curated static library
(``app.services.spark_library``) and never call the LLM. Conditions C and D
are the adaptive, intake-informed conditions and proxy validated requests to
the configured LLM, returning structured Spark card payloads.

Choice model (why no condition asks for a vibe up front)
---------------------------------------------------------
Participants generally cannot name the vibe they want before seeing a Spark, so
no condition takes ``frame_preference`` as a *user* input any more. B and D are
the same shape — one Spark per vibe, five cards — and differ only in that B draws
randomly from the static library while D adapts each card to the intake and ranks
the five against each other. Holding the choice set constant is deliberate: it
leaves adaptation and ranking as the only variables between the two conditions.
D's coverage is a target rather than a guarantee — a model that returns four
usable vibes yields four options, never an error.
In both, the chosen vibe is derived from the card the participant actually picks.
``frame_preference`` survives only as an internal request field, carrying an
explicit "switch to X vibe" adjustment on a C/D remix.

Remix model (conditions C/D only)
----------------------------------
The endpoint is stateless. The *client* owns the remix history:
- First generate: ``base_card=None``, ``adjustment_history=[]``
- Each subsequent adjust: ``base_card=<current card>``,
  ``adjustment_history=[oldest, ..., newest]`` (capped at 20 items).

The system prompt instructs the model to transform ``base_card`` in-place when
it is present, applying all accumulated adjustments cumulatively so the card
evolves rather than resetting.
