/** Condition B — five concrete Sparks, one per vibe.
 *
 *  Replaces the old vibe wheel. The wheel asked participants to name a vibe
 *  before they had seen a single Spark, which is a choice most people cannot
 *  make — the labels alone ("Challenge me") do not say what you would actually
 *  be doing. Here every vibe is represented by one randomly drawn Spark from the
 *  curated library, so the choice is made over the intervention itself and the
 *  vibe is whatever the chosen card happens to be.
